# BSOD Trigger

This Python script leverages `ctypes` to call Windows API functions that trigger a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD).

### Key Features:
- **Privilege Adjustment**: Elevates privileges for system-level access.
- **Hard Error Simulation**: Raises a critical error (0xC000007B) to crash the system.

### Caution:
Use with care, as this code can lead to system instability and potential data loss.
